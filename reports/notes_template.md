# Analysis Notes (Template)

Use this file to jot down observations after each run.

## Pair: song_a.wav vs song_b.wav
- Tempo (from notebook 01):
- Beat behavior (steady/free):
- Pitch summary: mean F0 A=..., B=...
- Pitch-class peaks (12-TET): A -> [...], B -> [...]
- Cosine similarity (MFCC means):
- Cosine similarity (PC hist):
- JS divergence (PC hist):
- PCA notes (overlap/separation):
- Hypothesis: What might explain similarities/differences? (scale, timbre, recording)

## Next tweaks
- Try different k for circular smoothing
- Try cents histogram (24 or 48 bins per octave) for microtonal resolution
